# Text Converter

This React app uses your device's camera to scan handwritten or printed text (e.g. from lecture notes) so that you can use and store the text digitally.

## How to Use
### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm must be installed on your computer. If Node.js and npm has not been installed on your computer, [this tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-install-and-use-node-js-and-npm-mac-and-windows/) can show you how to do so.

2. In Command Prompt, navigate to the directory in which the repository has been cloned/downloaded
3. Run the following command `npm install`
4. Next, run the app by executing the command `npm install`

### Usage
To use this app:
- Go to the "Scan Text" page from the menu in order to take pictures of the text that you would like to scan.
- As your text is scanned it will be added to the "View Text" page. Use the "View Text" page to view, edit or copy your text.
- By copying the scanned text, or by using the "Export Text" button in the menu, the text can be used digitally.
